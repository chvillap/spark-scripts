# Multiclass classification is supported via multinomial logistic (softmax)
# regression. In multinomial logistic regression, the algorithm produces K sets
# of coefficients, or a matrix of dimension KÃ—J where K is the number of
# outcome classes and J is the number of features. If the algorithm is fit with
# an intercept term then a length K vector of intercepts is available.

# Multinomial coefficients are available as coefficientMatrix and intercepts
# are available as interceptVector.

# coefficients and intercept methods on a logistic regression model trained
# with multinomial family are not supported. Use coefficientMatrix and
# interceptVector instead.
